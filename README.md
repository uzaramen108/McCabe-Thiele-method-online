# McCabe-Thiele Method Online



_&check;_ _English_ | [_Korean(한국어)_](README.ko.md)



**McCabe-Thiele Method Online** is created by undergraduate chemical engineering students, is a web-based simulation tool designed to help chemical engineering students and professionals visualize binary distillation processes. It automates the graphical construction of McCabe-Thiele diagrams to determine the theoretical number of plates, minimum reflux ratio, and optimal feed location. Future updates will provide tools for other chemical processes.

## Used Tech

This project utilizes a modern web stack to deliver an interactive engineering tool without the need for complex server-side infrastructure.

- **[Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/):**
  - Used as the core visualization engine to render the McCabe-Thiele diagram on the HTML5 Canvas.
  - Handles the precise plotting of the Equilibrium Curve, Operating Lines (Rectifying/Stripping), q-line, and the step-by-step stage construction.

- **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (PostgreSQL):**
  - Serves as the backend database to store Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) system data.
  - Allows the application to maintain a shared, persistent library of chemical systems that all users can access and contribute to.

- **LocalStorage (Web API):**
  - Implements a lightweight ownership management system.
  - Instead of a full authentication system, the application stores the unique IDs of user-created data in the browser's LocalStorage. This grants the creator "delete permissions" for their own data while keeping the platform open and accessible.

- **Webpack:**
  - Bundles JavaScript modules and assets for optimized production deployment.
